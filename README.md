# **Exercism Java Backup**

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and progress for the **Exercism Java Track**.
It serves as a personal backup, a reference for future study, and a way to track improvement over time.

Throughout these exercises, I’m practicing:

* Java basics (variables, loops, conditionals)
* Object-oriented programming (classes, interfaces, inheritance)
* Data structures and collections
* Clean code and best practices
* Test-driven development (TDD)
